# Electric-cycles-Sharing-Company (masked)

In this case study, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of the factors affecting the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market for an electric-bike sharing company. The analysis involved exploring the dataset using univariate and bivariate techniques to gain insights into the variables that could potentially impact the demand for electric-bike sharing services.

As part of the data analysis, I also performed outlier detection(IQR method) to identify any extreme values that may skew the analysis. I used various methods, such as box plots and scatter plots, to visualize the data and identify any outliers that may need to be removed.

To further validate the insights gained from exploratory data analysis, I performed hypothesis testing to determine whether there were any significant differences between the means of various variables. By doing so, I was able to identify the most critical factors that influence the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market.

Overall, this project involved a detailed analysis of the data using statistical techniques, including outlier detection, and provided valuable insights into the factors that can impact the demand for shared electric cycles. The results of this analysis can be used to make informed decisions regarding the marketing strategy, pricing, and expansion of the electric-bike sharing company.
